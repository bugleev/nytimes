<h2 align="center">Overview</h2>

This is a web application, that uses NY Times API. With the Article Search API, you can search New York Times articles from Sept. 18, 1851 to today, retrieving headlines, abstracts, lead paragraphs, links to associated multimedia and other article. 

* ### Stack Used

Aplication is made entirely in React js, using [Create React App](https://bugleev.com). The [Eject](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#npm-run-eject) command was used to add some custom components to the project (datepicker, spinner, etc). 

* ### Styling

I picked [Styled JSX](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx) library to use in the app. It provides dynamic and scoped styling, and overall, a very nice experience. The only downside is its usage with Create React App (had to tweak webpack config of CRA).

* ### Bonus

As Create React App provides utilities to convert any project to PWA, this app is really great to use as [Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) on the mobile phones (give it a try!).
